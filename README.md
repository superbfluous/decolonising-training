# Decolonising Training Project Materials

This repository contains materials from the Researcher Development Programme Team (University of Surrey’s) 2022 Decolonising Training Project. This project was one element of the Surrey Black Scholars programme, which was funded by the Office for Students.

The slides provided here are an updated version of the slides presented at the National Vitae conference for Researcher Development (September 2023). The project was discussed both in a plenary talk and a one-hour workshop at this event. The workshop was sold out and 96 places were booked.

The workshop abstract was posted on the conference website https://events.bizzabo.com/460722/agenda/session/1178015

Workshop attendees collectively provided a definition of ‘Decolonisation’, which appears in the updated slides. 69 participants completed a live poll during the workshop, the results of which can also be found in the slides.

The materials are designed to be shared as open access resources, for the researcher development community.

We hope that by sharing our materials, we can catalyse greater change around addressing inequity and improve ethnic minority PGR belonging in research and doctoral education across the sector.

Please feel free to browse these resources and borrow ideas for your own decolonising training work. We would appreciate it if you could please credit our original work, where possible.

The video links may expire and permissions have been sought. The PGR video we used in our vitae conference workshop has been removed to protect the identity and privacy of the PGRs involved.

Some of the materials were created in PDF form at the time of the project. We apologise for the inconvenience to those with screen readers. Please contact the project owners for assistance if you require this information in a different format.

We have provided contact details of staff who were available at the time for consultancy (October 2023). We cannot guarantee that all the links will remain valid.
